## Usage

On the main page, press the 'Get Started' button. Then, you will be able to add a note title and note text to a new note, and save it by pressing the icon in the top right corner. Once the note is saved, it will appear on the sidebar to the left, and you can either click the note's title to bring it up on the right side of the screen, or press the red trashcan icon to delete it.
